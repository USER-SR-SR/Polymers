        <h1>Polymers Overview</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Polymers</h2>
            <p>Polymers are large molecules composed of repeating structural units, called monomers, connected by covalent bonds. They can be natural or synthetic and are crucial in various industries due to their versatile properties.</p>

                <li><strong>Based on Structure:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linear Polymers: The monomer units are connected in a straight chain, like polyethylene.</li>
                        <li>Branched Polymers: Side chains or branches extend from the main polymer chain, altering properties.</li>
                        <li>Cross-linked Polymers: Chains are linked together through covalent bonds, forming a network structure, like rubber.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Based on Polymerization Mechanism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Addition Polymers: Formed by the repeated addition of monomers without the elimination of any byproducts.</li>
                        <li>Condensation Polymers: Formed through a condensation reaction where small molecules (such as water) are eliminated during polymerization.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
